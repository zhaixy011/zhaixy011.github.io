# Xiangyang Zhai's Academic Pages


Xiangyang Zhai (翟向阳) is a PhD student at Institutes of Science and Development, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).

His research interests lie at the intersection of **climate finance**, **climate risk management**, and **energy–economy–climate modeling**.

He focuses on understanding how financial systems respond to climate transition risks, and how integrated assessment models (such as GCAM) can be used to inform sustainable investment and policy design.

His current work explores the transmission of climate-related shocks across energy and financial markets, the modeling of carbon transition pathways under multiple socioeconomic scenarios, and the implications of climate policies for industrial structure and systemic financial stability.
