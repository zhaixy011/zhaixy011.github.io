      "summary": "This chapter reviews the development and status quo in the markets of several financial tools increasingly adopted to combat climate change. Financial institutions are increasingly offering sustainable loans tied to specific environmental performance targets and to incentivize borrowers to adopt sustainable practices. The market for green bonds has also experienced significant growth. The emergence and development of ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) bonds reflect investors&apos; increasing demand for greater transparency regarding the sustainability practices of companies. The insurance sector has developed fast worldwide to enable diversification to meet climate-related insurance demands. These trends in the development of climate financial tools reflect a growing recognition of the urgent need to address climate change and promote sustainable practices."

      "summary": "This chapter introduces the concept, categories and impacts of climate risks at the macro- and microeconomic levels, aiming to provide readers with an overall understanding of this critical topic. By establishing a conceptual framework, we seek to equip readers with the necessary foundation to navigate the subsequent discussions in this book. This chapter therefore sets the stage for a more profound exploration of climate risks in the subsequent contents of this book. Armed with the insights gained here, readers will embark on a more informed and enlightened journey through the complex terrain of climate challenges, thereby contributing to a collective understanding that is essential for informed decision-making and proactive adaptation in the face of an evolving climate landscape."

      "summary": "This paper studies how climate risks spill over to European electricity markets across time and frequency domains using the connectedness network approach. By introducing three climate risk measures\u2014the climate policy uncertainty index, climate physical risk index, and climate concern index\u2014the empirical results reveal the vulnerability of European electricity markets to volatile climate policies and extreme climate crisis events. Overall, the spillover effects in the climate\u2013electricity nexus are primarily concentrated in the medium- and long-term frequency domains, indicating that the impact of climate risk shocks is persistent. Compared with the impact of climate physical risks and climate concern shocks, the spillovers from climate policy uncertainty shocks to the electricity market are higher and more persistent. These findings highlight the need to consider the heterogeneous impacts of climate risks on electricity markets at different frequency bands."

      "releaseDate": "2025-01-01",
      "website": "../files/2025 Can climate factors improve the forecasting of electricity price volatility Evidence from Australia.pdf",
      "summary": "The increasing share of renewable energy generation and the frequent occurrence of extreme climate events have made the impact of climate factors on electricity price fluctuations increasingly prominent. This paper compares the forecasting accuracy of electricity price volatility in the Australian National Electricity Market before and after incorporating a series of climate factors into traditional heterogeneous autoregressive realized volatility (HAR-RV) models. The results show that climate factors, including precipitation, wind speed, maximum temperature, minimum temperature, and average temperature, have significant out-of-sample predictive value for the Australian electricity market. Compared to the widely studied HAR-RV model and the one which incorporates higher-order moments, our model achieved a maximum reduction in RMSE by 44.120 % and 26.227 %, respectively. Based on step-length electricity price volatility forecasting, long-term trends relating to climate factors should not be overlooked. The variable importance rankings of precipitation and wind speed in the volatility forecasting model is related to the dynamic changes in renewable energy generation, reflecting the sensitivity of electricity price fluctuations to the seasonal characteristics of climate, while sudden extreme weather events often lead to a significant increase in the importance rankings of related climate factors."
