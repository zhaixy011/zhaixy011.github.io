About me
--------------------------
Xiangyang Zhai (翟向阳) is a PhD student at Institutes of Science and Development, Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS).  
His research interests lie at the intersection of **climate finance**, **climate risk management**, and **energy–economy–climate modeling**.

He focuses on understanding how financial systems respond to climate transition risks, and how integrated assessment models (such as **GCAM**) can be used to inform sustainable investment and policy design.

His current work explores the transmission of climate-related shocks across energy and financial markets, the modeling of carbon transition pathways under multiple socioeconomic scenarios, and the implications of climate policies for industrial structure and systemic financial stability.
