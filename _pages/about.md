About me
--------------------------
Xiangyang Zhai (翟向阳) conducts research at the intersection of **climate finance**, **climate risk management**, and **energy–economy–climate modeling**.

Xiangyang Zhai is currently a Ph.D. student at the [Institutes of Science and Development](https://casisd.cas.cn/), [Chinese Academy of Sciences (CAS)](https://www.cas.cn/), under the supervision of [Prof. Qiang Ji (姬强)](https://casisd.cas.cn/sourcedb/zw/zjrc/201708/t20170815_4847096.html) since the fall of 2024.

Under Prof. Ji’s guidance, he studies climate financial risk modeling and participates as a core member in the [National Natural Science Foundation of China (NSFC) special project](https://www.nsfc.gov.cn/), “Pre-research on Key Theories and Technologies of Multi-Scale Mode Coupling in Natural–Social Systems toward Carbon Neutrality Pathways”.

His current work focuses on understanding how financial systems respond to climate risks and how integrated assessment models—such as GCAM—can be applied to support sustainable investment and climate policy design.

He is particularly interested in modeling the transmission of climate-related shocks across energy and financial markets, analyzing carbon transition pathways under different socioeconomic scenarios, and assessing the implications of climate policies for industrial structure and systemic financial stability.


Research and Publications
--------------------------
Xiangyang’s research has been published or is under review in international peer-reviewed journals in the fields of energy economics, environmental finance, and sustainable development.

He is also actively involved in interdisciplinary projects related to **climate risk stress testing** and **low-carbon transition pathways** in China.

Selected publications and ongoing work are available on the [**Publications**](/publications/) page of this site.
